 ShortRun-Differentiation-Paper-Code

 This folder contains the code to replicate the primary results from
 "The Short-Run Effects of Product Differentiation on Trade" by Peter R Herman and Ryan Lee. 
 It is assumed you have access to UN Comtrade, otherwise you will not be able to download the trade data.
 You'll want to set up your directory as follows:

         i. RawData      
         ii. Other
         iii. GravityData
         iv. Results
         v. Graphs


     Order of running code
         1. SR Product Differentiation Initial R Script (R)
         2. SR Product Differentiation Creation (do file)
         3. SR Product Differentiation Main Results (do file)
         
If you want to replicate any robustness checks, contact Ryan Lee at RLEE2@laverne.edu, though most of the provided code can be easily modified to produce the robustness checks.
